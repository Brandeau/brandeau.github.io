When I was 6 years old, my grandmother had the genius idea of enrolling me to the Chilean British Institute of Culture so I could learn English. This was a time where the language was not ubiquituous in society as it is now (my kid learnt it on their own just watching things on the Internet!). I would end up attending classes at that school for the next 11 years. I even went on to study the language yet again at the University of Santiago where I studied translation (and where I also learnt Portuguese and Japanese!). Since graduating in 2012, I've been working as a freelance translator.

During the COVID pandemic, I began to develop an interest in a different kind of language: not natural, this time, but programming languages. Following in the footsteps of my wife, who is a fullstack developer, I began my journey of learning how to program in languages like JavaScript and Python. I've been developing projects on my GitHub ever since.

I'm very passionate about the reduction of suffering, especially in nonhuman animals. Consequently, I've been leading a plant-based (and mushroom-based!) life since 2005. You can learn more about my efforts to help other animals here.
