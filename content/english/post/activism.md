I've been supporting efforts to extend ethical protection to other animals since 2005. 

From 2006 to 2009 I worked alongside like-minded people in the incipient animal rights movement in the country. As part of Homovegetus, what was then an organization of different individuals, I contributed to the fine-tuning of the organization's philosophical positions with regards to other animals and their moral worth. In conjunction with designers, I developed booklets, pamphlets, posters and other materials to spread awareness among the population regarding the suffering of animals, as well as the options available to reduce their suffering. I participated in protests, demonstrations and gave talks on the philosophy of animal rights and the plight of nonhuman animals. We regularly organized free and open events where documentaries on environmentalism, animal rights and other social issues where exhibited. I also worked on the event that became the first plant-based alternative to the country's Independence celebrations for three consecutive years.

From 2009 to 2011, I worked as an activist for Elige Veganismo doing mostly leafleting (sadly, this organization is now defunct).

In the intervening years, I participated sporadically in a miscellaneous arrangement of activities, including more talks and online engagement. Of special highlight for me was helping [Santuario Igualdad](https://www.santuarioigualdad.cl) during some weekends with the cleaning of the sanctuary.

During the COVID pandemic some friends and I began the Imperativo Altruista podcast to talk about all sorts of philosophical and real-world problems related to animals. In particular, the suffering experienced by animals in the wild. You can listen to the episodes [here](https://www.youtube.com/@imperativoaltruistapodcast1040) [In Spanish].

Around the same time, my friends and I developed an initiative to pool money and donate it to relevant organizations, with a special focus on organizations that provide some metrics of effectivity. You can learn more of our initiative here. [COMING SOON]
